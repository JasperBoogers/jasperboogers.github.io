# About Me
I am a Mechanical Engineer with a passion for innovation, thriving at the interface between motion control, hardware, software and electronics. I graduated as MSc in Mechanical Engineering at Delft University of Technology, with a focus Mechatronic System Design and electives in Control Theory. 

My experience spans from developing asymmetric hydrofoils for the worldâ€™s first flying hydrogen-powered boat to teaching student teams on composite (production) techniques and CNC machining. With a strong background in dynamics and hands-on skills such as CAD modelling, Python, and welding, I excel in dynamic, problem-solving environments with a get-your-hands-dirty aspect. Tangible results with a big challenge to get there!

Outside of work, I enjoy sports like cycling, mountaineering, and rowing, along with personal DIY projects. Sports - and being outside in general - really allow me to both relax and push myself in a physical manner.
